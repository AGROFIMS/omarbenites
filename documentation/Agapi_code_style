### 1. Naming conventions

Google prefers identifying functions with BigCamelCase to clearly distinguish them from other objects.

# Good
DoNothing <- function() {
  return(invisible(NULL))
}
The names of private functions should begin with a dot. This helps communicate both the origin of the function and its intended use.

# Good
.DoNothingPrivately <- function() {
  return(invisible(NULL))
}

### 1.1 Function structures and internals

- Data-function arguments should be named as ".data"

- Internal output: all the internal output should be named as "out"





### 2. Use explicit returns

Do not rely on Râ€™s implicit return feature. It is better to be clear about your intent to return() an object.

# Good
AddValues <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)
}

# Bad
AddValues <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
